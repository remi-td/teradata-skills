# Teradata React — Full-Stack Data App Skill

You help the user build a **live data application** against Teradata
Vantage using an opinionated React + FastAPI stack. Your job is to
deliver production-shaped output as fast as a notebook framework, by
following the patterns in this skill.

## When to use

- "Build me a web app for these tables / this query."
- "Turn this dashboard sketch into a real app."
- "Add a page that shows X from Teradata."
- "Containerize / deploy this analytic app."
- "Apply our brand to this React+Teradata app."

If the user just wants a single static page with mocked data, this is
overkill — write plain HTML/JS instead.

## Step 1 — Load references

Before writing any code, read:

1. [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md) — the shape
   you'll produce.
2. [references/design-guidelines.md](references/design-guidelines.md) —
   project layout, naming, definition of done, anti-patterns.

When you act in a specific area, load the matching deep-dive:

| Task                                          | Read first                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Writing/reviewing backend code                | [references/best-practices-backend.md](references/best-practices-backend.md) |
| Writing/reviewing frontend code               | [references/best-practices-frontend.md](references/best-practices-frontend.md) |
| Auth, secrets, SQL injection review, hardening| [references/security.md](references/security.md)        |
| Applying a customer brand or stylesheet       | [references/styling.md](references/styling.md)          |
| Justifying tech choice vs. Streamlit/Dash/etc.| [references/prior-art.md](references/prior-art.md)      |

## Step 2 — Confirm scope

Ask the user (one message, multiple choice when possible):

1. **Data**: which tables/views/queries should the app expose?
2. **Pages**: how many views, and what does each show?
3. **Branding**: Teradata default, customer stylesheet, or guidelines doc?
4. **Deployment**: local dev only, Docker, or static + remote API?
5. **Auth**: none (sandbox), reverse-proxy, or JWT?

Default to Teradata branding + Docker if the user is unsure.

## Step 3 — Scaffold

Copy the relevant pieces from [templates/](templates/) into the target
directory:

```
templates/backend/   → <project>/backend/
templates/frontend/  → <project>/frontend/
templates/deploy/    → <project>/deploy/
```

Then customize:

- `backend/app/settings.py` — confirm env-var names.
- `backend/.env.example` — fill `TD_HOST`, leave secrets blank.
- `frontend/src/theme/brand.css` — apply branding per
  [references/styling.md](references/styling.md).
- `README.md` — write a project-specific one (use
  [templates/README.template.md](templates/README.template.md)).

## Step 4 — Add features one at a time

For each user-requested view, follow this loop:

1. Write the SQL in `backend/app/queries/<resource>.py` as a
   `text("...")` constant + a pure function.
2. Add a Pydantic response model in `backend/app/schemas.py`.
3. Add a thin router in `backend/app/routers/<resource>.py` and
   register it in `main.py`.
4. Add a typed React Query hook in `frontend/src/lib/queries.ts`.
5. Add a page in `frontend/src/pages/<Resource>.tsx`, composed from
   `PageShell`, `DataTable` / `ChartCard`, and the hook.
6. Wire the route in `App.tsx` and add a sidebar link.
7. Smoke test: `uvicorn` + `npm run dev`, open the page, confirm all
   four states (loading / empty / error / success).

Every feature meets the Definition of Done in
[references/design-guidelines.md](references/design-guidelines.md#definition-of-done-per-feature).

## Step 5 — Deploy

Pick the target topology and follow
[templates/deploy/README.md](templates/deploy/README.md):

- **Local dev** — already running from Step 4.
- **Docker** — `docker compose up --build` from `deploy/`.
- **Static + remote API** — `npm run build` → push to GH Pages via the
  included Action; backend container deployed separately.

## Hard rules (apply on every edit)

- **All SQL is parameterized**. Never `f""`, `.format()`, or `+`.
- **Engine is a singleton** with `pool_pre_ping=True` and
  `pool_recycle=1800`. Never instantiate per-request.
- **Routers are thin** (≤20 lines). Logic lives in `queries/`.
- **Pages don't call `fetch`** — they consume hooks from
  `lib/queries.ts`.
- **No hex codes in JSX/CSS** — use Tailwind tokens from `brand.css`.
- **Every chart uses `ChartCard`**. Every data view handles four states.
- **Sync DB calls → sync route functions**. `teradatasqlalchemy` is
  not async.
- **Read-only DB user** unless writes are explicitly required.

If you find yourself wanting to break a rule, stop and re-read the
relevant reference. The rule almost always wins.

## Demo

A working multi-page demo over `dbc.*` views with Teradata branding is
in [demo/](demo/). Use it to:
- show the user what "done" looks like;
- copy patterns when you're unsure how to structure something;
- benchmark performance budgets against a real Teradata.

Run it locally:

```bash
cd demo
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env  # then fill TD_HOST/TD_USER/TD_PASSWORD
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
# or, dev mode:
(cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload) &
(cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev)
```
